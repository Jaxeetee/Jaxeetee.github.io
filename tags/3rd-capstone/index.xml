Shooting and Reloading Simply used Raycast for the shooting mechanic. For the reloading, I tried to use the animation events but it was so buggy since it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be called for some reason so I ended up scratching it and just used Task for the wait time before the player can shoot again.</description></item></channel></rss>
