<p>Project Lucid will be my personal project where my goal is to finish a game along with the mechanics and systems I haven&rsquo;t made yet. It&rsquo;ll be an ambitious project and hopefully it won&rsquo;t be discontinued</p>

Shooting and Reloading Simply used Raycast for the shooting mechanic. For the reloading, I tried to use the animation events but it was so buggy since it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be called for some reason so I ended up scratching it and just used Task for the wait time before the player can shoot again.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="my-contributions">My Contributions</h2>

<p>I found 2 ways on doing the grappling mechanic in Unity. 1st way is by using Spring Joints and the other way is by manual computation of the swing of the player through player&rsquo;s rigidbody position and velocity. I chose to use the latter one for me to be able to understand the Rigidbody any further. I found a <a href="http://shanekim.me/how-to-make-a-3d-grappling-hook.html">github blog</a> regarding this and used it for guidance.</p>

<p>Coding was tough but it works. Our grappling mechanics works in 2 ways, one for the &ldquo;Tarzan Swing&rdquo; as our designers have described it and the other way is when the player pulls theirselves close to the grapple point</p>

<p>The codes are a bit messy but once we continue the project, I will definitely refactor the code.</p>
<h4 id="weapon-crate">Weapon Crate</h4>
<p>There are originally 4 weapons in the game. Due to time constraints, I wasn&rsquo;t able to do a lot more complex coding for it. To be able to randomize it, I used the weight random system to be able to get random weapons. The weapon crate is only a one-time use and is subject to change once we finalize things for the future of the game.</p>

<h4 id="player-skill">Player Skill</h4>
<p>The original plan was to have multiple characters but I hadn&rsquo;t made any systems on it due to time constraints. As of the moment, the current player skill will be based on one type and is a bazooka with a projectile.</p>
